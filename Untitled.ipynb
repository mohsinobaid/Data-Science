    "#### Normal Distribution\n",
    "They state that averages of samples of observations of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal, that is, become normally distributed when the number of observations is sufficiently large.\n",

    "It is the power-law probability distribution that is used in description of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena.\n"
